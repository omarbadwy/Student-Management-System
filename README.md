# Student-Management-System
The Student Management System is a C program designed to manage student 
information efficiently. It allows the user to perform various operations such as 
adding new students, displaying all students, searching for a student by ID, 
updating student details, calculating the average GPA, and finding the student 
with the highest GPA.  
This system utilizes fundamental programming concepts including conditions, 
loops, strings, structs, and pointers, besides the ability to use data structures 
efficiently like the linked list.
